/**
 * iOS-Specific Component Token Overrides
 *
 * This file allows manual overrides of specific component token values
 * when automatic generation doesn't produce the desired iOS adaptation.
 *
 * Currently empty - all iOS adaptations are handled via primitives.css
 *
 * Usage:
 * 1. Prefer primitives.css for systematic changes (touch targets, spacing, etc.)
 * 2. Use this file only for component-specific edge cases
 * 3. Document every override with reasoning
 *
 * Examples of when to use overrides.css:
 * - A specific component needs different spacing than the primitive
 * - iOS native pattern differs significantly from web ELEVATE
 * - Temporary workaround for ELEVATE token generation issues
 *
 * Loaded after: primitives.css and ELEVATE core tokens
 * Generated to: ElevateUI/Sources/DesignTokens/Generated/*.swift
 */

/* Component-specific overrides go here */

/* Example (commented out):
 * $elvt-component-dialog-max-width: var(--elvt-component-dialog-max-width, 90vw);  // iOS needs wider modals on small screens
 * $elvt-component-notification-duration: var(--elvt-component-notification-duration, 4s);  // iOS users expect longer toast visibility
